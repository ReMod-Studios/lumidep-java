# Luminous Depths: Java Edition
A Project that brings in a whole new level of depth to Minecraft's oceans (pun intended).
From creatures such as the scary anglerfish to the curious isopods, new blocks, and strange structures.
Even new biomes that go deeper into the depths than ever before. Thermal vents full with magma, brine lakes with a new material!

### But we already have 1.13!
Yes we know and even though we have a variety of ocean biomes they don't have any real danger to them, aside from Guardians.
This project adds new biomes that go way deeper to a maximum Y-level of 10! Of course with the new height and depth increase of the Minecraft worlds we plan to make some biomes go down to Y-level -32.
If you want even more variety to your Minecraft oceans this project is for you!

### How do I get started?
Woah! Slow down there! If you want to help us with this project you have to do some things first:
* Read the Contribution Guidelines and use the correct formatting
* Fork this repository
* Create a new branch in *your own* fork and name it to what you are adding (e.g. coral-biome or purple-mooshroom)
* Add and delete what you have to
* Create a pull request on the original repository (where you forked it from)
* Be patient!

### How do I develop, use and test this project?
To develop new features you have to atleast have some knowledge of Java file structure and documentation, however, we use Kotlin for our mod. Since Minecraft uses a lot of Java-based files in its editable code having some form of understanding for it will be necessary.
To test these features you've added out you should first clone the workspace, generate your runs/sources, and do `./gradlew runClient` to test with features to see if they work or not.
To use the already existing code you'd have to download the files and port them into Minecraft manually.

### How can I help?
You don't have to be a developer or programmer to contribute to this project at all. There are many ways you can contribute to this project:
* Suggesting new features
* Fixing code errors (by using correctly formatted Pull Requests)
* Suggesting changes to already existing features
* Reporting bugs and/or rough animations/behaviors (in entities for example)
* And the list goes on!
If you want to suggest a features or change in one. Open an Issue with a clear indicator that you are talking about a suggestion and not a bug report. For bug reports open an Issue with a clear indicator that you are talking about a bug or glitch and not a suggestion.
